# Iris Flower Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on using machine learning to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, making it a classic example for beginners in machine learning.

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample includes the four aforementioned measurements. This dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for practicing classification algorithms.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model on the Iris dataset to accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements. This involves data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Methodology

The project will use the scikit-learn library in Python for data manipulation and model building. Various classification algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors, will be explored and compared for their effectiveness in classifying iris flowers.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained models will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation will be employed to ensure the generalization of the models.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to have a well-performing machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements.
