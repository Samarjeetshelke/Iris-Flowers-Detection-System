Setosa, versicolor, and virginica are three different species of iris flowers, and they can be distinguished based on certain characteristics, especially the measurements of their sepals and petals:

1. **Setosa (Iris setosa):**
   - Typically has the smallest petals and sepals.
   - Sepals are usually shorter and wider compared to the other two species.
   - Petals are usually shorter and rounder compared to the other two species.
   - Often has a more vibrant and distinct coloration, with shades of purple, pink, or white.

2. **Versicolor (Iris versicolor):**
   - Usually has medium-sized petals and sepals.
   - Sepals are longer and narrower compared to setosa but shorter and wider compared to virginica.
   - Petals are usually a mix of purple and blue shades, but they can also be pink or white.

3. **Virginica (Iris virginica):**
   - Typically has the largest petals and sepals among the three species.
   - Sepals are usually longer and narrower compared to the other two species.
   - Petals are usually longer and more elongated compared to the other two species.
   - Often has a more subdued coloration, with shades of deep purple, blue, or white.

These differences in morphology are often used in botany and machine learning to classify iris flowers into their respective species.
